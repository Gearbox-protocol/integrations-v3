# .savantdocs â€” file and directory patterns and documentation links
#
# Syntax:
#   - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored.
#   - Include patterns (no leading '!') specify files/directories or external URLs to include as documentation.
#   - Exclude patterns (leading '!') remove matching entries from the documentation scan.
#   - Glob patterns follow .gitignore-style ("**" for any directories).
#   - URLs (http:// or https://) are allowed and treated as documentation links.
#
