# .savantscope â€” file and directory patterns for scanning Solidity files
#
# Syntax:
#   - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored.
#   - Include patterns (no leading '!') specify files/directories to scan.
#   - Exclude patterns (leading '!') remove matching files from the scan.
#   - Glob patterns follow .gitignore-style ("**" for any directories).
#

# Include all contracts (only changed methods will be analyzed)
contracts/**/*.sol

# Exclude test files and directories
!contracts/test/**/*.sol
!**/test/**/*.sol
!**/tests/**/*.sol

# Exclude mock contracts
!contracts/test/mocks/**/*.sol
!**/mock/**/*.sol
!**/mocks/**/*.sol

# Exclude interfaces
!contracts/interfaces/**/*.sol
!contracts/integrations/**/*.sol
!**/interface/**/*.sol
!**/interfaces/**/*.sol
